      <p>Fascination with this material stems from its remarkable physical properties and the potential applications these properties offer for the future. Although scientists knew one atom thick, two-dimensional crystal graphene existed, no-one had worked out how to extract it from graphite. That was until it was isolated in 2004 by two Russian-born researchers at The University of Manchester, Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov.</p>

      <p>This was one of the pair's ‘Friday night experiments’ – sessions where they would head into the lab and try out experimental science not necessarily linked to their day jobs. This playful approach is fundamental to how Andre and Kostya work, seen as both a useful way of maintaining interest in a field as well as a means of generating new ideas.</p>

      <p>The problem was how to extract the graphene. Following discussions with colleagues, Andre and Kostya adopted a method that researchers in surface science were using – using simple Sellotape to peel away layers of graphite to expose a clean surface for study under the microscope. Once used, the tape was simply being thrown away. Yet no-one had noticed the material on the tape was thinner than the material produced by polishing. They had made graphene, yet had not realised it.</p>
