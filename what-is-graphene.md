# Graphene

There are actually quite a few methods for making graphene. Chemical Vapor Depostion (CVD), annealing Silicon Carbide, exfoliating graphite layers in chemicals.

But I do it by mechanical exfoliation. The general technique is to use mesas (flakes) of well ordered graphite:



and place them onto the sticky side of scotch tape. Then you fold the tape and graphite flake over on itself and pull the tape apart again so you get two patches of graphite, both now thinner than the original one. Repeat.

You see graphite is really just stacks of graphene layers and by pulling those layers apart again and again you will eventually get graphene.

Itâ€™s as simple (and cheap) as that. What is much more difficult (and expensive) is transferring that graphene onto a silicon wafer and finding it using a good enough optical microscope.

With this method you can get flakes up to 50 microns in dimension. Though the average flakes are 10 microns.
